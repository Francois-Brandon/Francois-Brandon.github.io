<div id="forloop">
  <h3>For Loop</h3>
  <p>There are 3 main components to a for loop.
    <ol>
      <li>Loop Inititialization</li>
      <li>Test Statement</li>
      <li>Iteration Statement</li>
    </ol>
    Syntax:<br>
    <code>for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement){<br>
      Code to be executed;<br>
    }</code><br><br>
    The <em>loop initialization</em> sets the starting value for counter.<br>
    The <em>test statement</em> defines the condition to either execute the code
    inside the loop or exit the loop.<br>
    The <em>iteration statement</em> increments or decrements the counter value.<br><br>
    Code Example:<br>
    Press the button to execute a counting for loop.<br>
    The loops starts with the counter at 0 and will run as long as it is less than 5.<br>
  </p>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
      function count() {
        var i;
        var text = "";
        for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
          text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
        }
        document.getElementById('foroutput').innerHTML = text;
      }
    </script>
    
    <button type="button" onclick="count()">For Loop</button>
    <div id="foroutput"></div>

</div>

<div id="forinloop">
  <h3>For/In Loop</h3>
  <p>The for...in loop is used to loop throught the properties of a
    JavaScript Object.<br><br>
    Syntax:<br>
    <code>for (variable in object){<br>
      code to be executed;<br>
    }</code><br><br>
    For each loop a property will be assigned to the variable. The code inside the
    loop will be executed until it has gone through every property.<br><br>
      Code Example:<br>
      Press the button to loop through all the properties for the player object.<br>
  </p>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
        function properties() {
            var player = {name:"Brandon", eyecolor:"Blue", haircolor:"Brown", age:30};
            var output = "";
            var p;
            for (p in player) {
                output += player[p] + " ";
            }
            document.getElementById('forinoutput').innerHTML = output;
        }
    </script>
    
    <button type="button" onclick="properties()">For/In Loop</button>
    <div id="forinoutput"></div>
</div>

<div id="whileloop">
  <h3>While Loop</h3>
    <p>The while loop will execute the statements or code block as long as the expression           evaluates as true.<br><br>
        Syntax:<br>
        <code>while (expression){<br>
        code to be executed;<br>
        }</code><br><br>
        Code Example:<br>
        A variable i is set to 0. The while loop will run while i is less than 5. The variable i will be incremented each time the loop is run. Press the button to see the output.
    </p>
    
        <script type="text/javascript">
        function whileloop() {
            var text = "";
            var i = 0;
            while (i < 5) {
                text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
                i++;
            }
            document.getElementById('whileoutput').innerHTML = text;
        }
    </script>
    
    <button type="button" onclick="whileloop()">While Loop</button>
    <div id="whileoutput"></div>
</div>

<div id="dowhileloop">
  <h3>Do/While Loop</h3>
        <p>Like the while loop, the do/while loop will execute the statements or code block as long as the expression evaluates as true. The difference is that the expression is evaluated after the loop is run. This will guarantee that the code or statements in the loop will be executed at least once<br><br>
        Syntax:<br>
            <code>do{<br>
            Statement(s) to be executed;<br>
            } while (expression);</code><br><br>
        Code Example:<br>
        A variable i is set to 5. The do/while loop will run then evaluate if i is less than 5. Since this will evaluate to false the loop will be exited. Press the button to see the output.
    </p>
    
        <script type="text/javascript">
        function dowhileloop() {
            var text = "";
            var i = 0;
            do {
                text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
                i++;
            } while (i < 5)
            document.getElementById('dowhileoutput').innerHTML = text;
        }
    </script>
    
    <button type="button" onclick="dowhileloop()">Do/While Loop</button>
    <div id="dowhileoutput"></div>
</div>
    
<div id="conditionalifs">
    <h3>If, Else, Else If</h3>
    <p>The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition evaluates to true.<br><br>
        Syntax:<br>
            <code>if (condition) {<br>
            block of code to be executed if the condition is true<br>
            }<br><br></code>
        The else statement is used in conjunction with the if statement. The else statement is placed after the if statement. The code in the else statement would be executed as an alternative to the code in the if statement, that is, if the condition evaluates to false<br><br>
        Syntax:<br>
            <code>if (condition) {<br>
            code to be executed if the condition is true<br>
            } else {<br>
            code to be executed if the condition is false<br>
            }<br><br></code>
        The else if statement is used to declare additional conditions after the first. If the first condition is false the next condition will be checked and so on until a true condition is found, else statement is reached, or all conditions are evaluated as false.<br><br>
        Syntax:<br>
            <code>if (condition1) {
            block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
            } else if (condition2) {
            code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
            } else {
            code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
            }
            </code><br><br>
        Code Example:<br>
        
        <script type="text/javascript">
        function ifelse() {
            var input = document.getElementById("color").value;
            var output = "";
            if (input == "red") {
                output = "This means Stop.";
            }
            else if (input == "green") {
                output = "This means Go.";
            }
            else {
                output = "I don't know what that means.";
            }
            document.getElementById('ifelseoutput').innerHTML = output;
        }
        </script>
        
        Enter "red" or "green":<br>
        <input type="text" id="color"><br>
        <button onclick="ifelse()">If, Else, Else If</button>
    </p>
    <div id="ifelseoutput"></div>
    
</div>
    
<div id="conditionalswitch">
    <h3>Switch</h3>
    <p>As an alternative to a series of if...else if statements a switch statement can be      used. As you can see in the syntax below, the switch statement will take the value of   the expression and match it with the cases. Each case will have a statement or code to execute if its condition is met. After each case statement the keyword break is used. This signifies the end of that particular case. Without the break statements each case following the true condition would be executed.<br><br>
    Syntax:<br>
        <code>switch (expression)<br>
        {<br>
        case condition 1: statement(s)<br>
        break;<br><br>
        case condition 2: statement(s)<br>
        break;<br>
        ...<br><br>
        case condition n: statement(s)<br>
        break;<br><br>
        default: statement(s)<br>
        }<br><br></code>
    Code Example:<br>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            function switchSelect() {
                var input = document.getElementById("month").value;
                var output = "";   
                switch (input) {
                    case '1':
                        output = "You were born in January"
                        break;
                    case '2':
                        output = "You were born in February"
                        break;
                    case '3':

</div>
    
<div id="functions">
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>Functions can be used to group code into reusable blocks. A function is defined with the function keyword followed by the name of the function. Immediately following the function name are parenthesis where any parameters being sent to the function are defined. The body or code block of the function is surrounded by curly braces. There is also the optional keyword <em>return</em>. This would allow a value to be returned from the function. <br><br>
    Syntax:<br>
        <code>function name(parameters, are, commaSeparated) {<br>
            statements;<br>
            return something; //optional<br>
            }<br><br>
        </code>
        Code Example:<br>
        <script>
            function calculate() {
                var amount = parseFloat(document.getElementById("amount").value).toFixed(2);
                var rate = parseFloat(document.getElementById("rate").value);
                var calc = amount * (1 + (rate / 100));
                var total = calc.toFixed(2);
                                      
                display(amount, rate, total)            
            }
            
            function display(amount, rate, total) {
                var output = "Amount: $" + amount + "<br>Tax: " + rate + "%<br> Total: $" + total + "<br>"
                
                document.getElementById('funcoutput').innerHTML = output;
            }
        </script>
        Enter cost of item: 
        <input type="text" id="amount"><br>
        Enter tax rate (ex. 7): 
        <input type="text" id="rate"><br>
        <button onclick="calculate()">Get Total</button>
    </p>
    <div id="funcoutput"></div>
</div>
    
<div id="arays">
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p>An array is an object that allows you to store many values in a single variable.<br><br>
    Syntax:<br>
        To create an array you use square brackets and separate the different values using commas.<br>
        <code>var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];</code><br><br>
        An array can also be created using the new keyword. If only a single number is used as a parameter then the array will be created with that length.<br>
        <code>var array_name = new Array(item1, item2, ...);</code><br><br>
        When an array is created the values are stored sequentially with the first value occupying the position with index [0]. The various elements can be accessed by referring to the index number. This can be used to either get or set the specified element. To access the second element you would use:
        <code>array_name[1];</code><br><br>
        There are many built in array properties and methods. For example, the length preperty will return the number of elements in the array.<br>
        <code>var tools = ["hammer", "saw", "screwdriver", "wrench"];<br>
            var length = tools.length;<br>
            document.write("The length is " + length);</code><br>
        <script>
            var tools = ["hammer", "saw", "screwdriver", "wrench"];
            var length = tools.length;
            document.write("The length is " + length);       
        </script><br><br>
        A summary of some other available properties/methods:
        <ul>
            <li>forEach() - Loop over an Array</li>
            <li>push() - Add to the end of an Array</li>
            <li>pop() - Remove from the end of an Array</li>
            <li>shift() - Remove from the front of an Array</li>
            <li>unshift() - Add to the front of an Array</li>
            <li>indexOf() - Find the index of an item in the array</li>
            <li>concat() - Creates a new array by merging existing arrays</li>
        </ul>
